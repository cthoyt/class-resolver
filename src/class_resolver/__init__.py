"""The :mod:`class_resolver` package helps you look up related classes and functions to parametrize your code.

Getting Started
---------------
An example might be when you have several implementations of the same algorithm
(e.g., fast, greedy one and a slow but correct one) and want to write a function
``run_algorithm`` that can be easily switched between them with a string corresponding
to the name of the implementation

.. code-block:: python

    from class_resolver import ClassResolver, Hint

    class Algorithm:
        def run(self, data):
            ...

    class GreedyAlgorithm(Algorithm):
        ...

    class CorrectAlgorithm(Algorithm):
        ...

    algorithm_resolver = ClassResolver.from_subclasses(Algorithm)

    def run_algorithm(data, *, algorithm: Hint[Algorithm] = "greedy"):
        algorithm = algorithm_resolver.make(algorithm)
        return algorithm.run(data)

Note that the string keys in the class resolver are ``"greedy"`` for ``GreedyAlgorithm``
and ``"correct"`` for ``CorrectAlgorithm``. That's because it knows the name of the base
class is ``Algorithm`` and it can infer what you mean.

Pass a string, class, or instance
---------------------------------
The ``Hint[Algorithm]`` signifies that the ``algorithm_resolver.make(...)`` function is very powerful. You can pass
it one of the following:

1. A string, like ``"GreedyAlgorithm"`` or ``"Greedy"`` or ``"greedy"`` and it deals with casing and the suffix
2. A class like ``GreedyAlgorithm``, ``CorrectAlgorithm``, or any potential subclass of ``Algorithm``
3. An instance of an ``Algorithm``, in case you have one pre-defined.
4. ``None``, if you defined the ``default=...` when you called ``ClassResolver.from_subclasses`` like in
   ``ClassResolver.from_subclasses(Algorithm, default=GreedyAlgorithm``.
